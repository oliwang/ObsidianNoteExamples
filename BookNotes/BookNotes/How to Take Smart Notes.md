desc: "The key to good and efficient writing lies in the intelligent organisation of ideas and notes. This book helps students, academics and nonfiction writers to get more done, write intelligent texts and learn for the long run. It teaches you how to take smart notes and ensure they bring you and your projects forward. The Take Smart Notes principle is based on established psychological insight and draws from a tried and tested note-taking-technique. This is the first comprehensive guide and description of this system in English, and not only does it explain how it works, but also why. It suits students and academics in the social sciences and humanities, nonfiction writers and others who are in the business of reading, thinking and writing. Instead of wasting your time searching for notes, quotes or references, you can focus on what really counts: thinking, understanding and developing new ideas in writing. It does not matter if you prefer taking notes with pen and paper or on a computer, be it Windows, Mac or Linux. And you can start right away."

# 简介

# Notes

我是为了学习新的笔记方式读的，结果感觉这本书更多的还是关于学术写作。

他最重要的观点大概就是不要去“计划”写作，而是通过平时的大量阅读和积累，合理的笔记方式，将想法记录储存下来，并且有机制可以时常回顾，将不同的notes串联成成熟的写作想法。如果已经有想法，并且有reference了，那么串联起来变成一个draft就没有那么困难，如果已经有了draft，那么对它进行修改，使他读起来通顺就没有那么困难。作者认为学术写作不应该是一个从0开始的过程。
